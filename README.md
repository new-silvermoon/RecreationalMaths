This repo contains code representing various Maths formulae, puzzles, sequences, etc.

1. Van Eck Sequence - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Eck%27s_sequence
2. Golden angle - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_angle

3. Sum of cubes - There is a popular conjecture in Maths which states that numbers that can be expressed as a sum of three cubes of integers,
 allowing both positive and negative cubes in the sum. Refer https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sums_of_three_cubes

    Andrew Booker wrote an algorithm in March 2019 in order to find the result for number 33. Refer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASoz_NuIvP0

    This code takes stab at Andrew's original algorithm in a Pythonic way.

4. Permutations generator -
